Changes in version 6
=====================

 - flush the proper bus (system bus) on shutdown

Changes in version 5
=====================

 - write a sendsigs.omit.d file to prevent upstart from killing us
   during shutdown.  This should fix the suspend-when-shutting-down
   issue once and for all.

Changes in version 4
=====================

 - don't exit-on-idle while shutting down to avoid losing the flag
   that tells us we are in the middle of a shutdown

 - flush bus before exiting on idle to avoid a race where a message
   is queued up but not yet sent

 - adjust the definition of "inactivity" to be 10 seconds after done
   processing the last request instead of 10 seconds after we started.
   This matters for long-running tasks (like suspends).

Changes in version 3
=====================

 - add a proper 'Unit' interface

 - clean up the interface to and implementation of the NTP support

 - add support for the poweroff, reboot, suspend, hibernate targets

Changes in version 2
=====================

 - Install a ntp-units.d file so that never versions of timedated don't assume
   that NTP is impossible.

 - dist the NEWS

Changes in version 1
=====================

 - Initialise the Virtualization id variable so that we return "" in the
   case that detecting virtualisation fails.
