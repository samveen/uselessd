remove procfs and sysfs references

some cgroups-related, proc and sysfs-related
unit options (particularly for resource control)
need to be removed

procfs/core ->
	src/core/condition.c [test_kernel_command_line()]
	src/core/dbus-execute.c [oom_score_adj]
	src/core/dbus-manager.c [/proc/cgroups and /etc/mtab]
	src/core/execute.c [oom_score_adj]

	src/core/killall.c [keep for now]

	src/core/kmod-setup.c [rm it entirely]
	src/core/locale-setup.c [/proc/cmdline for locale groups]
	src/core/main.c [test_mtab(), test_cgroups(), parse_proc_cmdline*,
	mount_cgroup_controllers() functions removed]

	src/core/manager.c [comments only]
	src/core/mount.c [mount_proc_self_mountinfo() removed]
	src/core/mount-setup.[ch] [mount_cgroup_controllers() rm'd]
	src/core/shutdown.c [kernel command line reading, procedures will likely be shafted anyway]
	src/core/swap.c [/proc/swaps-related routines]

procfs/shared ->
	src/shared/cgroup-util.c
	src/shared/fdset.c
	src/shared/sleep-config.c
	src/shared/util.c [/proc/self/* references]

procfs/other ->
	src/systemctl/systemctl.c [/proc/cmdline parsing]


systemctl -> displays "Running in chroot.", made running_in_chroot() from
util.c a no-op

----------

cgroups need to be weeded out
caveat: O_CLOEXEC may not be present

----------

cgroup-util.h ->

	dbus-unit.c: removed header
	execute.[ch]: remove exec_spawn()
		-> commented out in mount, service, socket and swap, as well
	manager.c: various struct members and checks
	unit-printf.c: specifier_cgroup* functions
	systemctl.c: service status-related cgroup functionality

	unit.c: needs total rework


	virt.h must be removed from sources
		removed test_virtualization() in condition.c
		removed detection in bus_manager_append_virt() in dbus-manager.c
		in job.c
		in locale-setup.c, header only
		in machine-id-setup.c
		main.c
		manager.c
		shutdown.c
		mount-setup.c
		swap.c

		done

--------

edited avoid_bus() in systemctl to sidestep error

-------

Managed to port systemd-shim. org.freedesktop.systemd1 interface
dependency is now satisfied.

Next up: Remove dependency on /run sockets, see dbus-common.c

Edited bus_connect_system_ssh() to return -EIO, due to lack of stdio-bridge

util.c: modify random_ull() and random_u() to use /dev/random and without
O_CLOEXEC

Specified custom D-Bus addresses to listen to in /etc/dbus-1.

Permissions issue in bus_check_peercred() leading to SCM_CREDS failure
when starting systemctl.

---------

Rewrite main.c to only start the important things (like the Manager
for systemctl) without segfaulting.

Redid main.c, touched up portions of manager.c. Ultimately, the issue
has been isolated to manager_startup() which will fail. When not present,
manager_loop() merely rotates clock_gettime() endlessly without fruition.
