In the event of autogen.sh not properly generating build-aux scripts, run `autoreconf -fi`
(potentially twice on some systems) instead.

------------

Run `make update-man-list` to regenerate manpages after modification.

------------

Run `perl hwdb/ids-update.pl` or `make hwdb-update` to update udev hardware database (relevant only for Linux builds).

------------

Run systemd as a system instance with `systemd --test` to determine and dump startup sequence after making a change, as a
preliminary form of debugging. You may need to specify the full path (e.g. /usr/lib/systemd/systemd), if it's not in your $PATH.

------------

Relevant directories and files when making a purge/addition:

src, for actual code
man, for manpages (rm or mod where necessary)
shell-completion, for bash and zsh routines (rm routines for tools no longer present, such as kernel-install)
units, for systemd unit files (services, targets, sockets, etc.) - rm or mod where necessary
configure.ac
Makefile.am
Makefile-man.am

and potentially others, e.g. sysctl.d for setting default dynamic kernel parameters

-----------

Read relevant files in test, for information on the testing suite.
