tons of utils log to LOG_TARGET_AUTO (journal), reverse those

SUCCESS

fucking tired right now, fatigued
apologies for the vagueness

removed logs-show.[ch] due to inclusion of sd-journal.h
removed cgroup-show.[ch], as well as cgls due to codependencies
refactored test-tables.c

Edited all files above with journal references

edited systemctl.c

added libsystemd-id128-internal.la to LIBADD section for systemctl in Makefile.am,
so that specifier.c will properly resolve sd_i28_* functions

removed all journald-related log targets, replaced all instances of LOG_TARGET_AUTO
with LOG_TARGET_SYSLOG_OR_KMSG (in 17 files, almost all tools besides generators)
