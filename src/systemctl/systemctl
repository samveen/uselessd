Query or send control commands to the uselessd manager.

-h --help                  Show this help message.
--root=PATH                Enable unit files in the specified root directory
--kill-who=WHO             Who to send signal to
-s --signal=SIGNAL         Which signal to send
--scope=UNIT_FILE_SCOPE    Can be one of system (default), global or user
                           (latter two are partially equivalent to --global and --user
                           from upstream systemd.)
--job-type=TYPE            What type of job for the manager to queue (start, stop, reload, etc.)
                           This is handled automatically by the unit commands, but may be useful
                           manually for debugging.
--job-mode=MODE            The mode with which to start the job (replace, fail, isolate, etc.)
                           Once again - handled automatically, may be used for debugging.
                           This option can be equivalent to --irreversible, --fail and
                           --ignore-dependencies from upstream systemd.
-f --force                 When enabling unit files, override existing symlinks
